* Utilize pandas to analyze microtransaction data for a mobile game

## Analysis
* According to this article from Forbes (https://tinyurl.com/y4v987gt) older users tend to spend the most money. Our game doesn't seem to follow this trend as the percentage of users in an age bracket account for nearly the same percentage of overall purchases.
  * This may indicate that our offerings appeal equally across age demographics, however it may be worth investigating if our offerings are failing to capture the extra spending potential of older demographics.
* According to our demographic breakdown our game appeals mostly to males in their twenties. However, our data shows that, on average, Women and Other/Non-disclosing groups spend more. 
  * It may be worth investigating how to make our game appeal more to those demographics.
* Mobile games can make a large amount of money from a small percentage of users that are willing to spend alot. These users are commonly referred to as "Whales". I added an extra data frame at the bottom of the notebook showing breakdowns for the top percentages of our spenders. 
  * It shows our top spenders are willing to buy the more expensive items and more items overall.
  * The dollar amounts aren't quite in whale territory. It may be worthwhile to try offering some more "premium" type products to entice them to spend more.
